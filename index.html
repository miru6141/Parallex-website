        <h2>What is the parallax effect in website design?</h2>
        <p>We can trace the parallax effect back to ancient Greece. Or at least the word “parallax”. In Greek, “Parallaxis” means “alteration” and that’s the backbone of the parallax effect. But altering what? In Physics, the parallax effect refers to how the position of objects that you look at change their position according to whatever position you, the observer, are in.
            For a real life example, imagine you’re driving through the countryside – no, more relaxing – you’re a passenger, sitting back and gazing at the fences by the side of the road whizzing past at lightning speed. A few fields away, in the horizon, you notice a forest. The position of the forest changes more slowly than that of the fence, which is closer to the car. This is the parallax effect in real life!

In this post, we’ll look at the parallax effect in action in web design as a scrolling feature as well as some best practices and some radical examples. Never forget you can prototype your own incredible parallax products with Justinmind’s prototyping tool. Enjoy!

        <h2>The origins of Halloween</h2>
        <p>If you think of Halloween, you probably think of scary carved pumpkins, all kinds of fancy dress and children asking for sweets. And if you think of a country that celebrates Halloween, you probably think of the United States first. Americans and Canadians have adopted Halloween in a big way, but Halloween traditions actually come from 16th-century Ireland, Scotland and England.

            The tradition of Halloween on 31 October comes from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Samhain was the Celtic New Year and they celebrated it on 1 November because that was the end of summer and harvest time (life) and the beginning of winter (death). It was also the time for ghosts to return to earth for a day. People lit a big fire, wore special clothes made of animal skin and hoped to be safe from the ghosts and the winter. In AD 609, the Catholic Church put the Christian celebration of All Saints Day on 1 November. In AD 1000, the church added All Souls Day on 2 November, and All Hallows Eve – or Halloween – moved to the night of the 31st.</p>
